üí¨ PULL QUOTES
--------------------------------------------------

‚Ä¢ 00:00:00 - 'Responses occurring within 50 to 120 milliseconds suggest subcortical pathways are involved in rapid responses.'

‚Ä¢ 00:10:18 - 'If I use the tool to measure something where I already know the answer, if it gives me the answer that I know is right, then that's some indication that the tool is actually measuring the world in a way that I care about.'

‚Ä¢ 00:31:29 - 'So this is roughly speaking white. So that's going to be 100% active. This is, roughly speaking black. That's going to be 0% active.'

‚Ä¢ 00:41:21 - 'It's a long way to break it down to an extremely condensed form, extremely low dimensional representation of something that is reality infinitely dimensional.'

‚Ä¢ 00:46:58 - 'Before 2017, it wasn't, sorry, 2017, it wasn't possible. You couldn't do this.'

‚Ä¢ 00:51:07 - 'The step of the process that I trust the least is visually verifiable.'

‚Ä¢ 01:06:06 - 'It's not because they're smart, it's because they're dumb. Super fast.'

‚Ä¢ 01:17:31 - 'Whenever I talk about balance, I keep using these terms like, you know, center of mass and base of support.'

‚Ä¢ 01:18:14 - 'The base of support is where my feet are in contact with the ground.'

‚Ä¢ 01:31:49 - 'The actual base of support is no longer foot. It's foot plus little balance point over there.'


üéØ KEY TAKEAWAYS
--------------------------------------------------

‚Ä¢ Interest profiling is limited to class-related chats to improve relevance.

‚Ä¢ Upcoming assessments involve empirical questions about units and human biomechanics.

‚Ä¢ Understanding of SI units and physical models like pendulums is essential.
