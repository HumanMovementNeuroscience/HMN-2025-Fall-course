üí¨ PULL QUOTES
--------------------------------------------------

‚Ä¢ 00:00:00 - 'Trust in analysis depends on each step of the pipeline.'

‚Ä¢ 00:00:00 - 'Using zero crossings to identify peaks in jump data.'

‚Ä¢ 00:13:19 - 'Because we're living in a sort of hyper simplified world, we basically get to throw away the height of the center of mass.'

‚Ä¢ 00:25:26 - 'Am I looking at signal or am I looking at noise? Signal to noise ratio is kind of like a whole other conversation.'

‚Ä¢ 00:29:53 - 'Effort and human labor that went into this import numpy line of code is really staggering.'

‚Ä¢ 00:48:00 - 'In this case, because we're looking at the Z direction in the vertical, which aligns with the sort of kinetic potential energy, we count that as a kinetic analysis.'

‚Ä¢ 00:49:37 - 'So you're just writing the number 30. This is anytime you're in code, if you see someone writing a specific number, like 3, 0, you want to be careful about that. I would prefer to pull the frame rate from the data store somewhere.'

‚Ä¢ 01:08:23 - 'Humans are naturally good at grasping velocity, acceleration, and motion'

‚Ä¢ 01:18:34 - 'The visualization helps to recognize cyclical patterns and relationships within the data.'

‚Ä¢ 01:32:11 - 'And yeah, this is when we, when we show up before class and then the previous class has all like the crazy math on the board. That's differential equations.'


üéØ KEY TAKEAWAYS
--------------------------------------------------

‚Ä¢ The integrity of each step in the data analysis pipeline is crucial for valid results.

‚Ä¢ Phasic movements like repeated jumps can be used to study patterned behaviors in natural systems.

‚Ä¢ Upcoming activities include data analysis, group paper comparison, and poster project preparation.
