üí¨ PULL QUOTES
--------------------------------------------------

‚Ä¢ 00:00:00 - 'You take this huge image data set, and you boil it down into just X and Y, which is much more manageable.'

‚Ä¢ 00:00:00 - 'Classical computer vision relies on analyzing raw pixel data, like luminance gradients, to identify features such as the sclera, iris, and pupil.'

‚Ä¢ 00:00:46 - 'It's not like the cleanest data for a number of reasons, but it's enough to kind of make the main points that we were trying to make about eye movements.'

‚Ä¢ 00:12:20 - 'The only way that any human has ever gotten good at anything is to do that thing over and over and over again.'

‚Ä¢ 00:21:56 - 'Videos generally, and I think by generally, I think almost universally, videos do not actually encode real measured timestamps from their frame rates.'

‚Ä¢ 00:33:34 - 'This pixel, if we were to go in there and measure it actually. Can I do that? I cannot. The value coming off of this is probably pretty close to 255. Like that's fully saturated. If anyone ever does photography. That kind of like that zebra stripes thing, that it will show up if the image is fully washed out is telling you this is the place where the sensor is maxed out.'

‚Ä¢ 00:44:55 - 'It's arbitrary. X and Y. Don't like they could be anything. We just chose those because they're like the weird letters at the end of the Alphabet.'

‚Ä¢ 01:04:02 - 'If you look at the. Look at. This is the game of look at the video. Take a video on your phone, look straight into the camera and then rotate your head like this. You'll see your eye doing torsion. It'll do like plus or minus 7 degrees.'

‚Ä¢ 01:22:42 - 'The only pieces of raw Data are the MP4 videos and the timestamps.'

‚Ä¢ 01:28:15 - 'Basically everything after this line is using the 3D spherical model.'
