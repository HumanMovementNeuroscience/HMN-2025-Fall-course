üí¨ PULL QUOTES
--------------------------------------------------

‚Ä¢ 00:00:00 - ''You need to know two numbers to define a two dimensional point.''

‚Ä¢ 00:00:00 - 'Kinetic energy equals 1/2 times mass times velocity squared, and the object‚Äôs energy is conserved during projectile motion.'

‚Ä¢ 00:00:00 - 'Newton's laws, while not perfect at cosmic scales, are sufficiently precise for most human-related and daily applications.'

‚Ä¢ 00:10:00 - 'Science as a method to create new knowledge for humankind.'

‚Ä¢ 00:12:20 - 'The most important thing to sort of... is that skepticism is the basis of scientific reality.'

‚Ä¢ 00:29:38 - 'Mathematics, like being able to do it on paper helps. The guy who taught the class before this, I'm sure would have many things to say about what I'm about to say, but I firmly believe that being able to do the math on paper is just. It's an extra layer of understanding on top of the gut check intuitions that will get you most of the way towards where you need to go.'

‚Ä¢ 00:41:52 - 'A liter is a thousand milliliters, and a milliliter is a cubic centimeter of water that weighs one gram.'

‚Ä¢ 00:49:14 - 'And we will soon be sort of getting to the biomechanics. And next week, the data that we're going to be collecting in class is going to involve things like the. It's going to involve standing balance.'

‚Ä¢ 01:18:20 - 'The concept of balance as the relationship between the center of mass and the base of support is something we're going to talk about a lot.'

‚Ä¢ 01:30:05 - 'Because notice a lot of it was just kind of like reconstructed from first principles. And. And so it's useful to be able to do that. So try to tell the story to someone else that you know later. And then when you hit parts, it's like, wait, how did you get from there to there?'
