üí¨ PULL QUOTES
--------------------------------------------------

‚Ä¢ 00:00:00 - 'Knowing enough about the technology to recognize the problem is part of troubleshooting and system management.'

‚Ä¢ 00:09:46 - 'And once again these top level folders.'

‚Ä¢ 00:23:54 - 'The process between the empirical measurement that happens on the cameras and the sort of resulting data that I want to analyze to do science is rigid.'

‚Ä¢ 00:33:02 - 'Most of our videos are skewed like that. But this is actually just the display, which is fine.'

‚Ä¢ 00:35:17 - 'The majority of research involving eye tracking is pupilometry because the majority of scientists are lazy cowards.'

‚Ä¢ 00:36:23 - 'Blink when your eyes are dry, whatever, like a cup every. I don't know, actually don't know what the normal cadence is, but you blink when your eyes are dry.'

‚Ä¢ 00:40:21 - 'The shape of your eyes is something you get past the cornea, you sort of go. The pupil, if not is just a void. It's just an empty hole.'

‚Ä¢ 00:49:22 - 'Enough like if you, like if you fixate your thumb and move it, move your head around, the blur in the background is the world moving too fast for your opsins to keep up?'

‚Ä¢ 00:57:16 - 'VOR is such a low level reflex that it's used as a proxy for brain death in emergency situations.'

‚Ä¢ 00:59:48 - 'Because as I said before, I think it tends to nail anything at the level of textbook.'
