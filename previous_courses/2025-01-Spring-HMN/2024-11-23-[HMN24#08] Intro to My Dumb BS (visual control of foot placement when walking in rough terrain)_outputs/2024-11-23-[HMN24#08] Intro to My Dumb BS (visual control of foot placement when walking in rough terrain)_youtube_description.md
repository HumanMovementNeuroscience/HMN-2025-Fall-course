01:08:15 - Visual and Motor Control in Ecological Experiments

01:18:00 - Analysis of Visual Motion and Eye Movements

01:27:45 - Exploring Visual Motion and Navigation Research


üí¨ PULL QUOTES
--------------------------------------------------

‚Ä¢ 00:00:00 - 'Humans are exceptionally good locomotives because we exploit physical dynamics for efficient movement.'

‚Ä¢ 00:00:00 - 'Foot placement accuracy decreases when the target turns off during the approach or after the foot leaves the ground, especially if not visible during the lead-up.'

‚Ä¢ 00:00:00 - 'The instructor shares their transition from philosophy to neuroscience, highlighting their research on visual control of locomotion.'

‚Ä¢ 00:00:00 - 'The shape of the retinal projection onto the ground forms an ellipse that is elongated at the upper visual field and condensed at the lower visual field.'

‚Ä¢ 00:27:06 - 'Hypothesis testing is bad. If you didn't know that that's not how we're supposed to do science anymore.'

‚Ä¢ 00:30:04 - 'The physics is important and it's represented by the skeleton.'

‚Ä¢ 00:51:20 - 'So this particular. So like if you only sort of flashed the targets on during this very narrow phase of gate, these are like 250 millisecond windows.'

‚Ä¢ 01:01:33 - 'This was arguably the cleverest thing I've done in my academic career because I had to.'

‚Ä¢ 01:10:30 - 'You, you're looking farther ahead in that flat terrain, but it turns out you're also walking faster.'

‚Ä¢ 01:29:59 - 'This is the diet that your visual system was raised on. They said the statistics of visual motion that your nervous system experiences during your everyday life.'


üéØ KEY TAKEAWAYS
--------------------------------------------------

‚Ä¢ The research emphasizes understanding natural visual-motor coordination during locomotion through innovative experimental methods.

‚Ä¢ Ecological experiments and outdoor eye-tracking reveal real-world strategies and neural mechanisms for navigation.
