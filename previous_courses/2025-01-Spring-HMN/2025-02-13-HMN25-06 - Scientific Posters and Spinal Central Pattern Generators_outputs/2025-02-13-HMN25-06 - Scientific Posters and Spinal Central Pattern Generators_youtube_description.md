üí¨ PULL QUOTES
--------------------------------------------------

‚Ä¢ 00:00:00 - 'The primary purpose of a poster is to distill a research paper for presentation at conferences, where the goal is to communicate efficiently in a short interaction.'

‚Ä¢ 00:01:30 - 'And then on Wednesday we'll do kind of like the sort of a small group kind of assignment to help you all prepare for the sort of exam, like assignment poster proposal too that will be due.'

‚Ä¢ 00:29:26 - 'The idea is that if the person had the poster given to them and they read it from start to finish, they would know, roughly speaking, the story that you're trying to tell.'

‚Ä¢ 00:32:41 - 'You want to see posters. Generally, if you just walk around a department in the school, you'll see posters on the wall. People put their favorite posters on the walls outside their lab.'

‚Ä¢ 00:39:40 - 'You need to cite it because, you know, for, if you're trying to figure out if you should trust this research that I'm presenting you, I need to tell you that the stuff I'm presenting depends on work that has come before me.'

‚Ä¢ 00:56:22 - 'This study is about the spinal cord and particular it's looking at spinal cord injury and trying to get at something like a. What has been a sort of Holy Grail type of thing for quite some time, which is the ability to heal spinal cord injuries.'

‚Ä¢ 01:03:31 - 'Your spinal cord is a part of your central nervous system and it can handle simple stuff.'

‚Ä¢ 01:09:34 - 'In most like biology related neuroscience y types of studies the last author is the person who runs the lab where the study was done and the first author is the person in the lab that generally did that work.'

‚Ä¢ 01:26:54 - 'They're trying to restore that ability to do that. And this is where there's a lot. There's a lot going on here in terms of methodology that I'm not. There's just too much depth to get into.'

‚Ä¢ 01:29:36 - 'The idea is that it taps into the kind of the way that we move our bodies in the world.'
