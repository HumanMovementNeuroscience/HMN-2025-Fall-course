üí¨ PULL QUOTES
--------------------------------------------------

‚Ä¢ 00:00:00 - 'The idea is to use the modern tech of computer vision to replace the markers used in traditional motion capture systems.'

‚Ä¢ 00:03:52 - 'The center of mass is the concept of center of mass is the thing that's the intuition that says that if I want to balance this stick on my finger, I put my finger under two fingers, under the midpoint of the total distribution of mass on the thing, and it balances there because there's the Same amount of pull on this side as there is on that side.'

‚Ä¢ 00:10:49 - 'Pendulums are very, very, very, very important in the history of science.'

‚Ä¢ 00:16:05 - 'If the projection of the center of mass has a distance here from the base of support, then in a very intuitive sense that gravity pulls things down gravitatively, pulling like that, and then this distance there will be sort of pushing the object away.'

‚Ä¢ 00:33:22 - 'The modern, sort of invention of video was created to study horses in motion based off a bar bet about whether horses ever had all four feet off the ground.'

‚Ä¢ 00:40:24 - 'Because it's sort of like this. It's like kind of a joke that I study neuroscience from the perspective of a skeleton because that's like physics wise, it's mostly skeleton.'

‚Ä¢ 01:05:11 - 'Thinking about the behavior, thinking about the mechanics, thinking about the joint torques, thinking about the fatigue, where does the energy come from?'

‚Ä¢ 01:17:06 - 'And all of that is going to happen under the hood very, very fast. And it's all just a bunch of. That kind of geometry hasn't changed in 1,000 years.'

‚Ä¢ 01:17:06 - 'It's just now being done much, much, much faster on a strange rectangle of silicone and electricity.'

‚Ä¢ 01:29:51 - 'Make some general predictions. I'm gonna make an assignment for y' all for next week about talking to the bot about predictions around this data stuff.'


üéØ KEY TAKEAWAYS
--------------------------------------------------

‚Ä¢ Understanding physical principles like center of mass, trajectories, and pendulum dynamics is crucial to study balance and movement.

‚Ä¢ Human postural control involves active neural mechanisms, with the human body modeled as an inverted pendulum.

‚Ä¢ Traditional motion capture systems are costly and complex; modern neural network-based markerless systems like Free Mocap are making biomechanics research more accessible.
