00:09:45 - Course Updates and Assignments Overview:
 The instructor discusses improvements in the AI's responses, new assignments, and upcoming poster presentation requirements.

00:19:30 - Neural Control of Human Movement and Perception:
 The video discusses neural control of human movement, the importance of perception, especially vision, and how these systems are studied through empirical data, motion capture, and eye tracking.

00:29:15 - Eye Movement Observation and Technology:
 The speaker discusses the significance of eye movement in understanding cognition and describes the setup and details of using infrared eye-tracking technology.

00:39:00 - Eye Tracking and Visual Perception:
 The speaker discusses challenges and phenomena related to eye tracking, infrared interference, pupil responses, and eye movements in natural behavior research.

00:48:45 - Eye Movements and the Visual System:
 This chunk explores the mechanics and functions of eye movements, including saccades, slow movements, and their relationship with the visual and oculomotor systems.

üí¨ PULL QUOTES
--------------------------------------------------

‚Ä¢ 00:00:00 - 'The instructor emphasizes the importance of timely submissions for the midterm chat and poster outline, designed to assist students in organizing their ideas.'

‚Ä¢ 00:00:00 - 'The vestibulo-ocular reflex is an extremely old reflex that links your vestibular organs with eye movements to stabilize what you see.'

‚Ä¢ 00:00:00 - 'Fluid in the inner ear's semicircular canals detects head rotation via inertia, which is affected by factors such as alcohol.'

‚Ä¢ 00:00:41 - 'I brought both an eye tracker and a computer today, which is many consider to be the minimum equipment set required to actually record eye tracking.'

‚Ä¢ 00:27:35 - 'The way that we use our vision and really the way that you experience your perceptual world is very, very coupled to your ability to make very fast and very precise eye movements at a pretty surprising rate.'

‚Ä¢ 00:31:56 - 'Infrared cameras are important for reasons I'll show in a second. And then this is an RGB camera.'

‚Ä¢ 00:42:23 - 'A light source coming in from the outside world is going to produce four different reflections.'

‚Ä¢ 00:52:26 - 'Saccades are what we would call fast eye movements. And then there's also these other kind of movements, which are these ones.'

‚Ä¢ 01:08:57 - 'Blinking is a strange and interesting behavior. And, like, the way that we choose when to blink is also kind of like strategically aligned within the eye movement in a way that sort of feels like the purpose of a blink is that these are mucous membranes. They have to stay wet.'

‚Ä¢ 01:19:32 - 'Most eye trackers do not track torsion. No eye tracker that I'm aware of tracks torsion.'


üéØ KEY TAKEAWAYS
--------------------------------------------------

‚Ä¢ An eye tracker and computer are essential tools for recording eye movements in research.

‚Ä¢ Upcoming course activities include a demo, poster presentations, and poster practice sessions.

‚Ä¢ Students are encouraged to practice presenting their posters to improve clarity and confidence.
