üí¨ PULL QUOTES
--------------------------------------------------

‚Ä¢ 00:00:00 - 'Learning how to navigate that, I think, is a really important skill, and I think AI will help us do that.'

‚Ä¢ 00:00:00 - 'AI is fundamentally transparent and shows how it works, which makes it different from past technologies that were easier to exploit and control.'

‚Ä¢ 00:04:27 - 'The amount to which you are being exploited financially to be in this room is absolutely indefensible and unconscionable.'

‚Ä¢ 00:08:07 - 'Trust people, don't trust institutions.'

‚Ä¢ 00:20:24 - 'Because the reality is that in the natural world, in the real world, your first reaction upon encountering something is often going to be confusion.'

‚Ä¢ 00:29:15 - 'Properly used, AI can significantly empower individuals and be a transformatively liberative tool.'

‚Ä¢ 00:39:47 - 'Language models do roughly the same thing. You push a bunch of words into their context window, push go, and it looks at its unbelievable sort of data set and provides a statistically most likely answer that is the expected and desired outcome of the input to the output.'

‚Ä¢ 00:41:57 - 'It is in fact possible to extract language from a large enough data set and some clever statistics without ever giving it explicit rules of grammar or explicit concepts of words.'

‚Ä¢ 00:51:21 - 'Textbooks are mostly wrong. That's kind of one of the secrets of if it has been around for long enough to be written down in a textbook, it's probably wrong at some level.'

‚Ä¢ 00:52:26 - 'The world's a lot murkier than we would like for it to be. And that is true of science. It's true of every field.'
