üí¨ PULL QUOTES
--------------------------------------------------

‚Ä¢ 00:00:00 - 'Perception and movement are often studied in isolation, but they're not really separable in natural behavior.'

‚Ä¢ 00:00:00 - 'The light that passes through the eye's passive optics is then processed in the retina, where it‚Äôs converted into neural activity.'

‚Ä¢ 00:00:00 - 'Pooling of signals from retinal layers influences perception, especially in peripheral vision.'

‚Ä¢ 00:20:39 - 'The main idea here was kind of this discovery of light as a thing that exists sort of independently in nature.'

‚Ä¢ 00:30:49 - 'The cornea is responsible for about 80% of the refraction that happens on your eye.'

‚Ä¢ 00:41:12 - 'Because you might say, and you might even be able to like, find some, some shiesty medical stuff online, suggesting that you need to, that you can, you can exercise the lens muscle and then you don't want, you won't need glasses anymore.'

‚Ä¢ 00:58:34 - 'The fovea is the area with the highest density of photoreceptors and is where we focus our gaze.'

‚Ä¢ 01:15:43 - 'Your eye, each of your eyes has six muscles on it.'

‚Ä¢ 01:20:00 - 'Your eyeballs are the fastest and most precise motor structures on your body.'

‚Ä¢ 01:30:31 - 'About 50% of your visual cortex is devoted towards that central 1 degree of your fovea.'


üéØ KEY TAKEAWAYS
--------------------------------------------------

‚Ä¢ The human eye features a complex structure with specialized components such as the cornea, lens, and retina, which work together to focus light and enable detailed vision.

‚Ä¢ Refraction at the cornea accounts for approximately 80% of the eye's focusing power, with other adjustments made by the lens through musculature.

‚Ä¢ Technologies like LASIK have been developed through a deep understanding of optics and laser technology, reshaping the cornea to correct vision.
