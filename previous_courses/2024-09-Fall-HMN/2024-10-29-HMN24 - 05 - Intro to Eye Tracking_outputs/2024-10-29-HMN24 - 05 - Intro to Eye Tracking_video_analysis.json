It highlights how these mechanisms help stabilize our vision and allow us to track moving objects, noting the voluntary and involuntary aspects of eye control.

It then covers the different types of eye movements, with a focus on saccades, smooth pursuit, torsional rotations, and their phylogenetic development. The speaker emphasizes that most eye movements are involuntary, controlled by reflexes and often outside conscious control, although voluntary control is possible at a cognitive effort. Practical aspects of recording eye data and calibration techniques are discussed, including tracking a thumb or target, and the real-world application of these recordings in movement studies and neurodiagnostics. The speaker also mentions how head rotations influence eye tracking data and the use of the vestibulo-ocular reflex as a clinical tool, such as a proxy for brain death, referencing the low-level reflex’s reliability.
