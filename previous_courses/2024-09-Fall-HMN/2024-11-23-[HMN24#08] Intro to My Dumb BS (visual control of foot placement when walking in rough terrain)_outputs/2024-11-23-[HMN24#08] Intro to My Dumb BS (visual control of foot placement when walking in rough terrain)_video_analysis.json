The conversation then shifts to ecological psychology, introduced by James Gibson, focusing on visual perception and control of movement without considering biomechanics or physics. The speaker describes early VR experiments from before Oculus, involving complex environments and experiments on perception of movement and safety margins. They express their interest in biomechanics and the physical aspects of movement, which led them to interdisciplinary work combining psychology, biomechanics, and robotics. They acknowledge the influence of their mentor, Brett Fajen, and reflect on their unconventional research path due to their initial lack of expertise, emphasizing the importance of mentorship and research freedom in their development.",
