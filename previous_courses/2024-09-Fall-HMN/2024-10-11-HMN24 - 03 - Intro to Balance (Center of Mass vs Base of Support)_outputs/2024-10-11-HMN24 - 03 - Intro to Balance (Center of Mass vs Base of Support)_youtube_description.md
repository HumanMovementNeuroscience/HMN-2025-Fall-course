üí¨ PULL QUOTES
--------------------------------------------------

‚Ä¢ 00:07:14 - 'It's also the first sort of entry point to like, hey, there's such a thing as interpreted text.'

‚Ä¢ 00:07:56 - 'Steal papers, steal textbook from Libgen. As a scientist, as operating under my academic freedom, it is the best thing I can do for you to say, fuck every publishing industry.'

‚Ä¢ 00:11:07 - 'Because we can't actually do the thing we want to do, which is like, have true knowledge of the real world, we have to cheat and take various sort of sidesteps.'

‚Ä¢ 00:22:52 - 'The finite element theorem says you can look at the center of mass as a proxy for the dynamics of the whole object.'

‚Ä¢ 00:32:02 - 'Newton's theory of reality where there was such a thing as position and velocity... are just ideas that are just ready but beside the point.'

‚Ä¢ 00:42:42 - 'passively stable where it is, if I perturb it from its sort of happy zero point, the resulting acceleration will pull it back towards that happy stable point.'

‚Ä¢ 00:52:49 - 'Because she's on her toe, her base, her anatomical base of support is very small, but she's on this ball that actually spreads out the center of pressure.'

‚Ä¢ 00:59:09 - 'CSV files are the raw version of what happens in my Excel.'

‚Ä¢ 01:02:38 - 'This is just a raw representation. If you wanted to draw the stick figures, you would need to have additional information saying how to connect the dots.'

‚Ä¢ 01:10:38 - 'We could also basically just like give yourself a longer time standing there. We could take this representation and couple it to the bigger visualization so we can actually verify.'


üéØ KEY TAKEAWAYS
--------------------------------------------------

‚Ä¢ Balance and center of mass are central to understanding human stability and movement.

‚Ä¢ Active neural control is essential to maintain balance due to the inherent passive instability of upright posture.

‚Ä¢ Models like the inverted pendulum effectively represent human balance, highlighting the necessity of active adjustments.
