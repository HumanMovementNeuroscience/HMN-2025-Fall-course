üí¨ PULL QUOTES
--------------------------------------------------

‚Ä¢ 00:04:27 - 'The amount to which you are being exploited financially to be in this room is absolutely indefensible and unconscionable.'

‚Ä¢ 00:08:07 - 'Trust people, don't trust institutions.'

‚Ä¢ 00:13:53 - 'The open source community is what the scientific community pretends to be like.'

‚Ä¢ 00:17:28 - 'Instead of taking my particular skill set and expertise which I have sort of accumulated over the course of decades now, using mostly taxpayer funding to pay my salaries and my paychecks and rather than trying to use that to just publish super esoteric papers that will only be beneficial to other super esoteric people, the goal was to try to package that same, use that expertise to build a tool that sort of meets a general need of society at large.'

‚Ä¢ 00:20:24 - 'The reality is that in the natural world, in the real world, your first reaction upon encountering something is often going to be confusion.'

‚Ä¢ 00:29:09 - 'This particular technology is different because unlike a lot of other tools and other like so things like computers and phones, like these are also world shaping technologies and they did shape the world and you were sort of a part of it.'

‚Ä¢ 00:30:08 - 'AI, I think, is different because it is fundamentally. It's like they're trying to build moats around the Mote Blaster 9000. Like, it is a tool that will teach you how it works and it will show you everything there is to know about itself.'

‚Ä¢ 00:31:53 - 'It is an unbelievably powerful tool that if you learn how to use it, whatever it is that you are trying to do in your life, if it involves the generation, sort of understanding, manipulation of text on a screen, AI can help with that.'

‚Ä¢ 00:39:47 - 'Language models do roughly the same thing. You push a bunch of words into their context window, push go, and it looks at its unbelievable sort of data set and provides a statistically most likely answer that is the expected and desired outcome of the input to the output.'

‚Ä¢ 00:52:26 - 'The world's a lot murkier than we would like for it to be. And that is true of science. It's true of every field.'
