A shift towards open-source, markerless systems is introduced as a more flexible alternative. The importance of timing in data recording is stressed, emphasizing that missing the moment means losing critical information about the underlying motor commands and neural activity. The discussion moves to the physics of light transduction, comparing it to human visual perception, and outlines how measuring light intensity is part of understanding visual stimuli. Calibration and inference are introduced as necessary steps to approximate the position and properties of measuring devices.
