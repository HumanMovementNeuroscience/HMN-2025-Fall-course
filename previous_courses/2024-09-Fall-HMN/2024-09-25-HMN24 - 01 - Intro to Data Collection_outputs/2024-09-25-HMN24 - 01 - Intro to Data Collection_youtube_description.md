üí¨ PULL QUOTES
--------------------------------------------------

‚Ä¢ 00:00:00 - 'Measurement is all about inferring feet from light, not the other way around.'

‚Ä¢ 00:01:13 - 'The field of neuroscience is largely designed to help us understand what the hell this is.'

‚Ä¢ 00:04:08 - 'There's often a trade off between empirical precision and ecological validity.'

‚Ä¢ 00:16:54 - 'The moment of recording is very, very important. This is the moment all this data is going away because we're not recording it because I didn't click the big red button.'

‚Ä¢ 00:22:36 - 'Calibration is basically a fancy word for trying to measure where all the cameras are relative to each other.'

‚Ä¢ 00:30:57 - 'It's basically just doing a bunch of geometry.'

‚Ä¢ 00:45:00 - 'There's a concept called the base of support. It's exactly what you think it is. There's also a concept called the center of mass. It's roughly what you think it is.'

‚Ä¢ 00:51:05 - 'You start with a qualitative estimate and then you measure the quantitative thing. And if they don't line up, something went wrong either in your measurement or in your intuition or both.'

‚Ä¢ 01:01:46 - 'This part where it draws a skeleton on top. I guess you probably haven't seen much of that data yet, so I'll show it to you in a second.'

‚Ä¢ 01:10:31 - 'Because this is the trajectory of the whole body. I don't want to analyze that. I. So luckily we can boil this whole guy down into just this.'


üéØ KEY TAKEAWAYS
--------------------------------------------------

‚Ä¢ FMRI is the most comprehensive non-invasive neuroimaging tool but has limitations in ecological validity.

‚Ä¢ There is an inherent trade-off between measurement precision and ecological validity in neuroscience research.

‚Ä¢ Invasive neural recording methods offer high precision but are mostly limited to non-human animals and face practical constraints.
