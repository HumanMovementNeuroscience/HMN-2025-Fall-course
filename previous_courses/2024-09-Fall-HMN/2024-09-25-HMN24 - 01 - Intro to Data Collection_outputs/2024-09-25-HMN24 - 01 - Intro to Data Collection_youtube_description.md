üí¨ PULL QUOTES
--------------------------------------------------

‚Ä¢ 00:01:57 - 'And a lot of the scientific world that we live in this sort of has this very reductionist feel and sort of underlying philosophy of reductionism where the goal is to measure things with increasing precision at finer and finer levels.'

‚Ä¢ 00:03:28 - 'But I don't. But yeah, let me rephrase that. No you can't. But a lot of people believe that you can and we respect their efforts.'

‚Ä¢ 00:16:54 - 'The two weirdest things in the universe are light and human behavior.'

‚Ä¢ 00:21:27 - 'It's always the feet. And okay, so if you recall, we're going to measure, we're going to record stuff from cameras, right? There's subtle hints in the environment that that's what's going to happen.'

‚Ä¢ 00:33:07 - 'This is doing optimization right now to figure out. Basically use the measurements that we got to figure out where each camera was in space.'

‚Ä¢ 00:33:49 - 'Rotation is like moving. So basically it's position translation from the origin. 0, 0, 0. Because it's camera zero.'

‚Ä¢ 00:45:00 - 'There's a concept called the base of support. It's exactly what you think it is. There's also a concept called the center of mass. It's roughly what you think it is.'

‚Ä¢ 00:53:47 - 'And basically what that means is for a period of time, I put more force into the ground than I weigh. So I was periodically freed from the tyranny of earth.'

‚Ä¢ 00:59:57 - 'And it all kind of goes together. And luckily for us, unlike the motherfuckers that made the motion capture system, everybody that wrote the code that went into this pink line shared it, they allowed other people to use it, and they allowed their effort to make the world a generally better place where any human can do more things than they could have done before that person did that work.'

‚Ä¢ 01:11:41 - 'Physics is pretty rigid. And I can make a lot of estimates about what was going on at some approximation by just looking at this weird shape.'


üéØ KEY TAKEAWAYS
--------------------------------------------------

‚Ä¢ FMRI is the best non-invasive tool but has significant limitations in ecological validity.

‚Ä¢ Direct electrophysiological measurements offer high precision but are invasive and site-specific.

‚Ä¢ Current technologies strive to balance detailed neural data with naturalistic behavioral observations.
