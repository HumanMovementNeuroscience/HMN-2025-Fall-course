takeaways:
- FMRI is the best non-invasive tool but has significant limitations in ecological
  validity.
- Direct electrophysiological measurements offer high precision but are invasive and
  site-specific.
- Current technologies strive to balance detailed neural data with naturalistic behavioral
  observations.
- There is an inherent trade-off between the accuracy of measurement and ecological
  validity.
- Recent advances aim to enable movement and behavior recording in more realistic
  settings.
- Modern motion capture methods have shifted from marker-based systems to markerless
  solutions using cameras.
- Constraining the environment simplifies measurements but may alter the natural phenomena.
- The critical importance of recording data at the moment of capture, as it cannot
  be recovered later.
- Light measurement involves capturing intensity at multiple wavelengths, similar
  to human vision.
- Calibration helps determine device positions, crucial for accurate light measurements.
- Data from such measurements aims to help infer internal states like brain activity,
  despite inherent challenges.
- Calibration objects with known dimensions are essential for verifying camera accuracy.
- Camera positions and orientations must be precisely measured and fixed after calibration.
- Proper lighting and environment setup are crucial for high-quality camera data.
- Synchronization of camera frames is critical for accurate motion capture and is
  achieved by aligning frames within a 33ms window.
- Camera positions are estimated using optimization techniques, with fixed cameras
  preferred for reliable measurements.
- Camera parameters include position (in millimeters) and orientation (Euler angles
  in radians), which are crucial for spatial accuracy.
- Initial calibration involves capturing poses like the T pose before moving on to
  dynamic activities.
- Practical considerations such as camera stability and setup testing are essential
  for successful data collection.
- Maintaining balance involves complex neural and physical coordination.
- The base of support and center of mass are critical for static equilibrium.
- Humans evolved from tree-dwelling ancestors, leading to our unique upright posture.
- Shifting weight and leaning require active management of forces and support.
- Understanding these principles is essential for physical training and injury prevention.
- System tracks only human bodies, not objects like kettlebells.
- Qualitative estimates of movement can be validated with quantitative data.
- Applying force greater than body weight results in the ability to jump.
- Understanding physics helps explain human motion.
- Human effort in data processing is immense and foundational to technological progress.
- The development of information theory and algorithms is a collective effort built
  on shared knowledge.
- Motion capture involves triangulating from multiple laser points and projecting
  2D images into 3D space.
- Convolutional neural networks enable machines to draw skeletal structures from images,
  a process that remains largely qualitative and visually verified.
- Open source tools like Blender can be used beyond their original purpose for scientific
  visualization and analysis.
- The most magical part of this pipeline is the ability to visually confirm the accuracy
  of skeletal tracking, which relies on human intuition.
- Measuring complex human shapes involves abstract dots and inferences rather than
  direct measurement.
- Sharing knowledge and tools freely accelerates collective progress and reduces exploitation.
- Complex body movements can be simplified to rigid bodies for easier analysis.
- Estimating force exerted during actions like jumping is possible with limited data
  and physics principles.
