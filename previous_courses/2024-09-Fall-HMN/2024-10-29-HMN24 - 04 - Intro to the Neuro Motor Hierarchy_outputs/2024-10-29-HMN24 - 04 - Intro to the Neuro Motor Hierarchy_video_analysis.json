He emphasizes that this map is a rough approximation and that real neural representations are much more distributed and complex. The discussion points out the close proximity of the motor cortex and somatosensory cortex and how their organization supports sensory-motor integration.

Specifically, in Parkinson's disease, the gating for motor initiation is too strong, preventing movement, whereas in Huntington's disease, there's a failure to suppress inappropriate movements, causing involuntary actions. The discussion includes the neural circuitry involving the superior colliculus, which suppresses competing motor commands until one surpasses a threshold.

Embodied cognition is introduced as a framework that considers humans as integrated with their tools, communities, and environments. The discussion proceeds to detail the functions of the cerebellum's lower regions in motor coordination, including flexion and extension movements, and how misfiring can lead to movement disorders such as ataxia. A brief mention of the brainstem follows, noting its role in sensory integration and low-level processing. The focus then shifts to the spinal cord, correcting misconceptions about its extent and structure, describing its unique opposite internal organization, and its critical role in reflexes like the knee-jerk response, as well as in motor control at the lowest processing level.",

The hierarchical nature of motor control is covered, detailing how high-level plans translate sensory inputs into specific reflex configurations suitable for environmental interactions. The role of muscle synergies is touched upon, illustrating how muscles act in coordinated groups rather than individually. The discussion then shifts to the corticospinal tract, which bypasses simpler pathways for fine motor control, emphasizing its significance in humans' extraordinary adaptability and precise motor learning, such as in gymnastics.
