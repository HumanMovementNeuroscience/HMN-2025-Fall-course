## Course Description

Students will explore the neural basis of natural human behavior in real-world contexts (e.g., [[sports]], [[dance]],
or [[everyday-activities]]) by investigating  [[biomechanics]] and  [[neuroscience]] of [[human-movement]]. The course
will cover [[philosophical]], [[technological]], and [[scientific]] aspects related to the study of [[natural-behavior]]
while emphasizing hands-on, project-based learning. Students will use [[free-open-source-software]],
and [[artificial-intelligence]],[[machine-learning]] and [[computer-vision]] driven tools and methods to record human
movement in unconstrained environments.

The course promotes interdisciplinary collaboration and introduces modern techniques for
decentralized [[project-management]], [[AI-assisted-research-techniques]], and [[Python]]-based programming (No prior
programming experience is required). Students will receive training in the use of AI technology for project management
and research conduct, including [[literature-review]], [[data-analysis]], [[data-visualization]],
and [[presentation-of-results]]. Through experiential learning, students will develop valuable skills in planning and
executing technology-driven research projects while examining the impact of structural inequities on scientific inquiry.

## Course Objectives

- Gain exposure to key concepts related to neural control of human movement.
- Apply interdisciplinary approaches when collaborating on complex problems.
- Develop a basic understanding of machine-learning tools for recording human movements.
- Contribute effectively within a team setting towards achieving common goals.
- Acquire valuable skills in data analysis or background research.

## Learning Outcomes

### Design and conduct a research project

- Develop a research plan
- Conduct a literature review
- Compile, analyze, and interpret empirical results
