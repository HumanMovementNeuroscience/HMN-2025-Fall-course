## Course Description

Students will explore the neural basis of natural human behavior in real-world contexts (e.g., [[sports]], [[dance]],
or [[everyday-activities]]) by investigating  [[biomechanics]] and  [[neuroscience]] of [[human-movement]]. The course
will cover [[philosophical]], [[technological]], and [[scientific]] aspects related to the study of [[natural-behavior]]
while emphasizing hands-on, project-based learning. Students will use [[free-open-source-software]],
and [[artificial-intelligence]],[[machine-learning]] and [[computer-vision]] driven tools and methods to record human
movement in unconstrained environments.

The course promotes interdisciplinary collaboration and introduces modern techniques for
decentralized [[project-management]], [[AI-assisted-research-techniques]], and [[Python]]-based programming (No prior
programming experience is required). Students will receive training in the use of AI technology for project management
and research conduct, including [[literature-review]], [[data-analysis]], [[data-visualization]],
and [[presentation-of-results]]. Through experiential learning, students will develop valuable skills in planning and
executing technology-driven research projects while examining the impact of structural inequities on scientific inquiry.

## Course Objectives

- Gain exposure to key concepts related to neural control of human movement.
- Apply interdisciplinary approaches when collaborating on complex problems.
- Develop a basic understanding of machine-learning tools for recording human movements.
- Contribute effectively within a team setting towards achieving common goals.
- Acquire valuable skills in data analysis or background research.

## Learning Outcomes

### Design and conduct a research project

- Develop a research plan
- Conduct a literature review
- Compile, analyze, and interpret empirical results
- Present research to a group

## Assignments

### Poster Assignment

At the end of the semester, you will present (individually or with a group, depending on your preference) a poster at a
Symposium event designed to mimic a poster presentation session at a scientific conference. This Symposium will be
attended by all 10+ sections of Biol2299 - It’s super fun! Your poster assignment is the Big Assignment for this course,
but don't worry about it. You'll be fine :)

### Other Assignments

There will also be a number of relatively casual assignments throughout the semester that will be explained as they come
up.

These assignments will be all be mechanical/checkboxy in nature, i.e.  "Have a chat with the bot in #XYZ channel for at
least `n` messages" or "Have at least `X` citations logged in your Zotero bibliography" etc.
